# Terraform Beginner Bootcamp 2023

## Semantic Versioning :mage:

This project is going to utilize semantic versioning for its tagging. 
[semver.org](https://semver.org/)

The general format: 

**MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH**, eg `1.0.1`

- **MAJOR** version when you make incompatible API changes
- **MINOR** version when you add functionality in a backward compatible manner
- **PATCH** version when you make backward compatible bug fixes

## Install the Terraform CLI

### Considerations with the Terraform CLI changes
The Terraform CLI installation instructions have changed due to gpg keyrings changes. So we needed refer toi the latest install CLI instructions via Terraform Documentation and change the scripting for install.

### Considerations for Linux Distribution

This project is built against Ubuntu. 
Please consider checking your Linux distribution and change accordingly to your distribution needs.

[How to check OS Version in Linux](https://www.cyberciti.biz/faq/how-to-check-os-version-in-linux-command-line/)

Example of checking OS Version:
```
$ cat /etc/os-release
PRETTY_NAME="Ubuntu 22.04.3 LTS"
NAME="Ubuntu"
VERSION_ID="22.04"
VERSION="22.04.3 LTS (Jammy Jellyfish)"
VERSION_CODENAME=jammy
ID=ubuntu
ID_LIKE=debian
HOME_URL="https://www.ubuntu.com/"
SUPPORT_URL="https://help.ubuntu.com/"
BUG_REPORT_URL="https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/"
PRIVACY_POLICY_URL="https://www.ubuntu.com/legal/terms-and-policies/privacy-policy"
UBUNTU_CODENAME=jammy
```

### Refactoring into Bash Scripts 

While fixing the Terraform CLI gpg depreciation issues, we noticed that bash scripts steps were a considerable amount more code. So we decided to create a bash script to install the terraform CLI. 

This bash script is located here: [./bin/install_terraform_cli](./bin/install_terraform_cli)

- This will keep the Gitpod Task File ([.gitpod.yml](.gitpod.yml)) tidy.
- This allow us an easier time to debug and execute manually Terraform CLI install
- This will allow better portability for other projects that need to install Terraform CLI

#### Shebang 

A Shebang (pronounced Sha-bang) tells the bash script what program that will interpret the script. eg `#!/bin/bash`

ChatGPT recommended this format for bash: `#!/usr/bin/env bash` 

- for portability for different OS distributions 
- will search the user's PATH for the bash executable

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shebang_(Unix) 

#### Execution considerations 

When executing the bash script we can use the `./` shorthand notation to execute the bash script.

eg. `./bin/install_terraform_cli`

If we are using a script in .gitpod.yml we need to point the script to a program to interpret it. 

eg. `source ./bin/install_terraform_cli`


#### Linux Permissions 

In order to make our bash scripts executable, we need to change linux permissions for the fix to be executable at the user mode. 

```sh
chmod u+x ./bin/install_terraform_cli
```

Alternativaly: 

```sh
chmod 744 ./bin/install_terraform_cli
```

### Gitpod Lifecycle (Before, Init, Command)

We need to be careful when using the Init because it will not rerun if we restart an existing workspace

https://www.gitpod.io/docs/configure/workspaces/tasks

### Working Env Vars

#### env command

We can list out all Enviroment Variables (Env Vars) using the `env` command

We can filter specific env vars using grep eg. `env | grep AWS_`

#### Setting and Unsetting Env Vars

In the terminal we can set using `export HELLO='world`

In the terrminal we unset using `unset HELLO`

We can set an env var temporary when just running a command

```sh
HELLO='world' ./bin/print_message
```
Within a bash script we can set env without writing export eg.

```sh
#!/usr/bin/env bash

HELLO='world'

echo $HELLO
```

#### Printing Vars

We can print an env var using echo eg. `echo $HELLO`

#### Scoping of Env Vars

When you open up new bash terminals in VSCode it will not be aware of env vars that you have set in another window.

If you want to Env Vars to persist across all future bash terminals that are open you need to set env vars in your bash profile. eg. `.bash_profile`

#### Persisting Env Vars in Gitpod

We can persist env vars into gitpod by storing them in Gitpod Secrets Storage.

```
gp env HELLO='world'
```

All future workspaces launched will set the env vars for all bash terminals opened in thoes workspaces.

You can also set en vars in the `.gitpod.yml` but this can only contain non-senstive env vars.
